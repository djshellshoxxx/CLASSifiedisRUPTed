# PS-137-05 — Authorization and capabilities: Unit testing

**Status:** SPECIFIED (Stage 3). **Module:** [F17.S01.M01 Unit testing](SPEC.md) · **Scope:** MVP · **Code:** `tests/unit-conventions` · **Contracts:** [CTR-TST-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-TST-001.md), [CTR-ID-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-ID-001.md), [CTR-MNY-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-MNY-001.md), [CTR-OBS-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-OBS-001.md), [CTR-PRV-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-PRV-001.md), [CTR-FED-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-FED-001.md), [CTR-CAP-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-CAP-001.md)

## Requirements

- **PS-137-05.R01** The module requires no capabilities and must not import relay session code, so unit tests cannot call authorize() against a live session.
- **PS-137-05.R02** Unit tests of authorization logic use pure authorize() with constructed actors from fixtures (CTR-CAP-001 CAP-2).
- **PS-137-05.R03** Test files and fixtures are excluded from production build outputs by the package files allow list.

## Specification

_None._

No runtime capabilities of its own: this module runs only in developer shells and CI jobs. Under ADR-0016 (CTR-CAP-001 CAP-8) the tests exercise two layers: vault policy (local principal mutates only its records; incoming signed statements accepted only from a key authorized for the role, else quarantined) and relay policy (relay-signed requests or relay access tokens). Tests never ship in the PWA or relay bundles.

Default deny; evaluation and audit per [CTR-CAP-001](../../../planning/contracts/CTR-CAP-001.md).

## Verification

| Test | Level | Covers | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TEST-PS-137-09.T09 | unit | PS-137-05.R01, PS-137-05.R02 | import of relay session code from a unit test; pure authorize() with fixture actors | import rejected by dependency rule; authorize returns Allow and Deny for fixture roles |
| TEST-PS-137-09.T10 | integration | PS-137-05.R03 | build the production bundles and list their files | no test or fixture files present |
